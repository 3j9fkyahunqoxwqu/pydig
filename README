Program:	pydig (a DNS query tool written in Python)
Version:	1.00
Written by:	Shumon Huque <shuque@gmail.com>

Description:

	A small python program to perform DNS queries. It works mostly 
	similarly to the dig program that comes with Bind. I wrote it 
	mostly for fun, while trying to understand DNSSEC. And in general, 
	for most queries, there is no reason to use it in preference to 
	dig. However, it does a few things differently that I needed from 
	time to time, such as: optionally presenting a hexdump of the 
	resource data rather than decoding it; decoding the exponent in 
	a RSA/SHA-1 DNSKEY; printing out names of DNSSEC related crypto 
	hashes, algorithms and algorithm parameters, key sizes; counting 
	how many compression references  were followed; implementing the 
	0x20 bit case randomization hack; providing more detailed statistics 
	on TSIG authenticated zone transfers, reporting query/response size 
	amplification factor, etc. It also has an option to walk a DNSSEC 
	secured zone and enumerate  all its resource records - this obviously 
	only works on NSEC zones.

	RR type and class codes (qtype and qclass) unknown to this 
	program can be specified with the TYPE123 and CLASS123 syntax.

Usage:

	pydig [list of options] <qname> [<qtype>] [<qclass>]
	pydig @server +walk <zone>

Options:

        -h                        print program usage information
        @server                   server to query
        -pNN                      use port NN
        -bIP                      use IP as source IP address
        +tcp                      send query via TCP
        +aaonly                   set authoritative answer bit
        +cdflag                   set checking disabled bit
        +norecurse                set rd bit to 0 (recursion not desired)
        +edns0                    use EDNS0 with 4096 octet UDP payload
        +dnssec                   request DNSSEC RRs in response
        +hex                      print hexdump of rdata field
        +walk                     walk (enumerate) a DNSSEC secured zone
	+0x20			  randomize case of query name (bit 0x20 hack)
        -4                        perform queries with IPv4
        -6                        perform queries with IPv6
        -d                        request additional debugging output
	-k/path/to/keyfile        use TSIG key in specified file
        -iNNN                     use specified message id
        -tNNN                     use this TSIG timestamp (secs since epoch)
        -y<alg>:<name>:<key>      use specified TSIG alg, name, key

Example usage:

       pydig www.example.com
       pydig www.example.com A
       pydig www.example.com A IN
       pydig @10.0.1.2 example.com MX
       pydig @dns1.example.com _blah._tcp.foo.example.com SRV
       pydig @192.168.42.6 +dnssec +norecurse blah.example.com NAPTR
       pydig @dns2.example.com -6 +hex www.example.com
       pydig @192.168.72.3 +walk secure.example.com
       pydig @192.168.14.7 -yhmac-md5:my.secret.key.:YWxidXMgZHVtYmxlZG9yZSByaWNoYXJkIGRhd2tpbnM= example.com axfr
       pydig @192.168.14.7 -yhmac-sha256:my.secret.key.:NBGFWFr+rR/uu14B94Ab1+u81M2DTqB65gOv16nG8Xw= example.com axfr

Limitations:

	Expects well formed (ie. correct) DNS responses. Otherwise 
	it will likely generate an exception and terminate itself
	ungracefully.

	Certain combinations of options don't make any sense (eg.
	+tcp and +edns0). pydig doesn't bother to check that, and 
	just ignores the nonsensical ones. Certain options also 
	imply other options, eg. +walk and +dnssec imply +edns0.

	For TSIG (Transaction Signature) signed messages, the program
	supports HMAC-MD5/SHA1/SHA256/SHA384/SHA256. It doesn't yet
	support GSS-TSIG.

	It does not yet verify signatures in DNSSEC secured data.

	It does not perform iterative resolution (eg. dig's +trace).

Pre-requisites:

	Python 2.5 (or later)

Platforms:

	Tested on the following platforms:
		Solaris 8, 9, 10, and 11
		Linux 2.x
		FreeBSD 9.x
		Mac OS X 10.4 through 10.7

	and with Python 2.3 - 2.7

Installation:

	1. (as root) python setup.py install
