Todo List (ie. things I might implement in the future)

* Move compression pointer count inside DNSresponse class
* Failover to other nameserver addresses (v4, v6, multiple etc)?
* UDP - ignore id mismatched responses and keep waiting till timeout
* Should we set AD by default, and have -adflag (instead of +adflag)?
* Check last AXFR record is SOA
* Attach copyright/license
* -d doesn't work any more?
* Support EDNS0 payload size setting

* Redo zonewalk() routines.

* Persistent TCP:
  - add pipelining

* Decode URI, and other new types of records
* Implement +trace --> iterative resolution
* Make sure TSIG record in response is the last record in additional section
* Decode old-style DNSSEC RR types: KEY, SIG, NXT
* Try additional nameservers from /etc/resolv.conf if necessary
* Support IXFR queries, by means of syntax 'ixfr=NNN'
* Support SIG(0) channel security mechanism
* Validate DNSSEC secured data via configured trust anchors
* Decode DKIM
